CS401 Assignment#1 Simple Calculator
Description:
Create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The
calculator should be a console-based application that allows users to enter two
numbers, select an operation, perform the calculation, display the result, and then
choose whether to perform another calculation or exit the program.
Specifications:
1. The calculator should support at least four basic operations: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Users should be able to enter two numbers and select an operation.
3. The program should handle invalid input gracefully and prompt the user to enter
valid input if necessary.
4. After performing the calculation, display the result to the user.
5. Allow the user to choose whether to perform another calculation or exit the
program.
